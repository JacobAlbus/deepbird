# deepbird
An attempt to use reinforcement learning on flappybird

## Project Structure

The game itself is built ontop of a game engine which was largely derived from the amazing *Advanced C++/Game Tutorials* youtube series found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@makinggameswithben/playlists). The game engine is a mix of OpenGl and SDL. Further, development was done on Visual Studio 2022 but since this repo includes the header, lib, and dll files for the SDL and OpenGl libraries, any system with a C++ compiler should be able to compile the source code.

## Reinforcement Learning

All reinforcement learning algorithms used in this project can be found in Sutton and Barto's [book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf) on the matter.
